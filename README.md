**Project Mission**

Our project serves to be an extension of project 2, in which we had to build a point of sales system imitating Chick Fil A. In this iteration of our system, we will be creating a refined user interface, with graphical upgrades to be on par to the quality of a product to be released in production. In addition to refining the graphical user interfaceâ€™s appearance, we wish to make our product accessible to everyone, including people who have any sort of disability. Our system will be built in a way that allows users to interact with the components in various different ways depending on their inability to perform the actions that would be easier for people without the disability.

**Developer Startup**
